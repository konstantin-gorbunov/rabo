Thank you for returning your work on Github. I received feedback from the team. But... We've now had a look at it together with the other applications we received and I'm sorry to inform you that we have decided to proceed with other candidates for this role at this point.

Also, we would like to give more elaborate feedback because we realise you spend time on it. I asked the team for more feedback, but due to lack of time we're not always able to, so if we don't get back to you about that we apologise, but hope you could understand.
We receive reactions from a lot of strong candidates and we are very critical in our selection so don't let it demotivate you! Still we appreciate your interest shown in MediaMonks and your time spend to work on our exercise.
